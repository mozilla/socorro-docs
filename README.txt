Socorro Docs
============

Repo used for the building and preparing the docs that will eventually
be placed inside the `socorro <https://github.com/mozilla/socorro>`_
repository.

The reason for this is to allow for a period of high frequency of
changes (pushes, pulls, pull requests, etc) without cluttering the
socorro repository.

ReadTheDocs
-----------

The latest version of socorro docs is available on `ReadTheDocs
<http://readthedocs.org/docs/socorro/en/latest/>`_

This repository automatically re-builds the docs on ReadTheDocs.
